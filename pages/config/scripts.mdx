# Scripts

Here we will be going to add some more example scripts to the contenthook cli for you to learn how to use.

## Example Scripts
- start
- build
- test

How do we use these scripts with the contenthook cli now?
Simply add these scripts to the `scripts` object in the `contenthook.config.js` file.

```js {2-6} copy
module.exports = {
  scripts: {
    start: 'next dev',
    build: 'next build',
    test: 'jest'
  }
}
```

Important! Make sure you have the required dependencies installed in your project to run these scripts.

## Usage
```bash copy
$ contenthook run start
$ contenthook run build
$ contenthook run test
```
