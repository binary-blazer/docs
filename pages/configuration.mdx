# Configuration

In this section, you will find more information about configuring your first ContentHook project.

First, run the following command to create a new project:

```bash copy
$ contenthook init
```
If you have an API Key already, run the following command insead of the first one:

```bash copy
$ contenthook init --key <your-api-key>
```
ATTENTION:
- Replace the `<your-api-key>` with your API Key.
- You can find your API Key in the ContentHook Dashboard.
- The API Key is a secret key, so do not share it with anyone.

The command will ask you some questions. Answer them and the project will be created. Below you can see the questions and the example answer.

The highlighted questions explained:
- `? Do you want to use an environment variable for the API key?` - If you choose `Yes`, the API Key will be stored in an environment variable. If you choose `No`, the API Key will be stored in the configuration file.
- `? Enter the name of the environment variable for the API key:` - This is only asked if you have chosen to store the API Key in an environment variable. You can choose a name for the environment variable.
- `? Enter your ContentHook API key:` - This is only asked if didn't ran the command with the `--key` flag. You have to enter your API Key here.
- `? The contenthook package is not installed. Do you want to install it?` - This means, that the ContentHook package is not installed locally in your project yet, so you have to install it. If you choose `Yes`, the package will be installed. If you choose `No`, you have to install it manually by following the instructions in the [Installation](/installation) section.
- `? Which package manager do you want to use?` - If you have chosen to install the package, you have to choose a package manager. The options are `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm` and `bun`. It checks which of those package managers are installed on your system and only shows the installed ones.
