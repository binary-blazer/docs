# Getting Started
 
Welcome to the ContentHook Docs! We are excited to have you here. This documentation will help you get started with ContentHook and guide you through the process of setting up your project. Also you can view all commands and some information about them and of course, also all flags and configuration objects.

## What is ContentHook?

ContentHook is very powerful content compiler working with a cloud. When setting a project up, you are asked to create a local content path. In this folder you can create `MD`, `MDX`, and `Markdown` files. With the `contenthook push` command, you can push the content to the cloud. The cloud will then compile the content and send it to our content files registry. Now you can import the content fetch functions in your Backend project like a `NodeJS` project or in a frontend project, for example with `VueJS`, `NextJS`, `etc.` This way you can easily manage your content through the cloud and locally, and have a clear overview of your project.

In the next page, you will find more information about installing ContentHook.
